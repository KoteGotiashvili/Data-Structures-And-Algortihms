# Data Structures and Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms from scratch. The aim is to understand the inner workings of these fundamental concepts by building them manually. Below is the list of data structures and algorithms included:

- **Binary Search Tree:** An efficient data structure for storing sorted data and supporting quick lookups, insertions, and deletions.

- **Doubly Linked List:** A list where each node contains a reference to both the next and the previous node, allowing for bidirectional traversal.

- **Graph:** A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent various types of networks and relationships.

- **Hashtable:** A data structure that implements an associative array, providing fast data retrieval based on key-value pairs.

- **Linked List:** A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next, enabling efficient insertions and deletions.

- **Queue:** A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure used for managing tasks in order.

- **Recursion Exercises:** Examples and exercises to understand and practice recursive algorithms.

- **Stack:** A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure used for managing tasks in a reverse order.

- **Tree:** A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with each node having zero or more child nodes.

Each implementation is designed to be simple and educational, focusing on the core principles and operations of the data structure or algorithm.
